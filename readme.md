# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project uses the OpenCV library to detect faces in a video stream captured from the default camera.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```python
git clone <https://github.com/<username>/face-detection-opencv.git>

```
2. Install the required packages:

## Usage

1. Run the following command in your terminal:

```python
python3 face-detection.py

```

2. The video stream from the default camera will be displayed with rectangles around the detected faces.


3. Press 'q' to stop the video and close the window.
